Code used to generate the results in the thesis: "Identifying Success Factors in Online Learning by Subgroup Discovery".
This code is divided into 4 (numbered) sections:
Section 1: deals with the data importing and formatting.
Section 2: involves EDA
Section 3: runs subgroup discovery for all feature groups (this is used for some functions in section 4)
Section 4: runs all results used in the paper, figures and tables.
--> Do note that not all of them are just plotting results, some (hyperparameter tuning/subgroup discovery once) functions do run subgroup discovery again.
