Code used to generate the results in the thesis: "Identifying Success Factors in Online Learning by Subgroup Discovery".
This code is divided into 4 (numbered) sections: <br />
Section 1: deals with the data importing and formatting.<br />
Section 2: involves EDA<br />
Section 3: runs subgroup discovery for all feature groups (this is used for some functions in section 4)<br />
Section 4: runs all results used in the paper, figures and tables.<br />
--> Do note that not all of them are just plotting results, some (hyperparameter tuning/subgroup discovery once/cosine) functions do run subgroup discovery again.
